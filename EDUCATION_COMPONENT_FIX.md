# Education Component Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Education component was not displaying properly because it was expecting different property names than what was provided in the data.

## Data Structure (portfolio.js)
```javascript
export const education = [
  {
    id: 1,
    degree: "Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology",
    institution: "Gujarat Technological University", 
    duration: "2022 - 2026",  // ✅ Fixed: was expecting 'period'
    gpa: "8.7/10.0",         // ✅ Fixed: was expecting 'grade'
    location: "Gujarat, India",
    description: "...",
    coursework: [            // ✅ Fixed: was expecting 'relevantCourses'
      "Data Structures and Algorithms",
      "Machine Learning",
      // ... more courses
    ]
  }
]
```

## Component Fixes Applied

### 1. **Property Name Corrections**
- `edu.period` → `edu.duration`
- `edu.grade` → `edu.gpa` (with "GPA: " prefix)
- `edu.relevantCourses` → `edu.coursework`

### 2. **Removed Non-existent Sections**
- Removed `edu.achievements` section (not in data)

### 3. **Updated Stats to Match Reality**
```javascript
const stats = [
  { title: "Degree Programs", value: "2", description: "Academic qualifications" },
  { title: "Coursework Completed", value: "13+", description: "Technical subjects" },
  { title: "Current GPA", value: "8.7", description: "Academic performance" }
]
```

## Result
✅ **Education component now properly displays:**
- Both degree programs (B.Tech IT and Higher Secondary)
- Correct duration periods (2022-2026, 2020-2022)
- GPA information (8.7/10.0, 92.5%)
- Complete coursework lists for both programs
- Professional black and white design with semantic icons

## Black & White Design Maintained
- ✅ Semantic icons: GraduationCap, BookOpen, Target
- ✅ Professional gray-scale color palette
- ✅ Perfect dark/light mode compatibility
- ✅ No colorful elements remaining

The Education component now correctly reflects Jenish Barvaliya's actual educational background and achievements.
